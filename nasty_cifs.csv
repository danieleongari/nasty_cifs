000,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.7b07920 converted to P1 and standardized with manage_crystal, methyl groups have 6 hydrogens instead of 3
001,made, first and second atoms are the same
002,raspa converted directly with manage crystal, there are only few atoms because I printed P1 without unwrapping the symmetry
003,made, net charge of 1.6 electrons
004,https://github.com/core-cof/CoRE-COF-Database/blob/master/CoRE-COF-DT280-v2.0/120.cif, the unit cell should be 33.03 33.03 4.2 (http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C6CC09906H) but it was parsed wrongly
005,hkust-1 P1 conventional cell, this is the conventional cell but I would like to be noted that I can use a smaller primitive cell for running calculations
006,DEYDOA_clean_min_charges from the 502 CoRE MOFs opt+DDEC, one metal is not in the right place (possibly it was on the boundary and it was not treated properly when deriving the primitive)
