0,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.7b07920 converted to P1 and standardized with manage_crystal, methyl groups have 6 hydrogens instead of 3
1,made, first and second atoms are the same
2,raspa converted directly with manage crystal, there are only few atoms because I printed P1 without unwrapping the symmetry
3,made, net charge of 1.6 electrons
4,https://github.com/core-cof/CoRE-COF-Database/blob/master/CoRE-COF-DT280-v2.0/120.cif, the unit cell should be 33.03 33.03 4.2 (http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C6CC09906H) but it was parsed wrongly
5,hkust-1 P1 conventional cell, this is the conventional cell but I would like to be noted that I can use a smaller primitive cell for running calculations
6,DEYDOA_clean_min_charges from the 502 CoRE MOFs opt+DDEC, one metal is not in the right place (possibly it was on the boundary and it was not treated properly when deriving the primitive)
7,MIL-127 from CCDC, Fe and Co atoms have partial occupancy and they are superimposed: this is a problem for simulations. The lone oxigen is probably OH or water. 
8,Mercado2018 hCOF linker109_C_linker15_C_sql_relaxed_ch, I expect a 3D material but this is a 2D COF and the layers are too spaced (this unit cell would collapse upon relaxation)
9,Mercado2018 hCOF linker92_C_linker10_C_hca_relaxed_ch, I expect a 3D material but this is a 2D COF and the layers are too spaced (this unit cell would collapse upon relaxation)
10,Mercado2018 hCOF linker92_C_linker10_C_kgd-a_relaxed_ch, I expect a 3D material but this is a 2D COF and the layers are too spaced (this unit cell would collapse upon relaxation)
11,produced by accident,cell is too large because I confused cell angles with cell lengths when parsing the cp2k output to cifs
12,produced by openbabel,"somehow, cifs produced with openbabel/avogadro have other indents and ase and pymatgen have problems reading them "
13,Znbttfbbc / water database,missing hydrogens 
14,UiO-66 / structure_comp,unbound water 
15,DMOF-TF /  structure_comp,DABCO rings have a particularly nasty type of disorder that make it hard to remove it by an automatic routine (at least the approached I tried failed) 
16,Znbttfbbc /  structure_comp,"several issues for me (besides missing H): The file contains a lot of information that I do not need: uncertainities in the positions and refinement information, "
17,DMOF-NO2 / structure_comp,disorder groups marked by ?
